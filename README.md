# Dorito.exe

## Origin
A long time ago, I made a program called Test OpenGL Project with Visual Studio 2019 by following a C++ OpenGL Tutorial.
This program only drew a triangle with a specific color.

But I realized if I made the color orange, the triangle looked like a nacho cheese Dorito.
So I decided to name it Dorito.exe and it became a little gag I would send around sometimes (the program was like 732kb).

On 5/9/2021, I realized most people couldn't use the program (for multiple reasons), so I decided to make this program instead.
And because, I don't want people to think it's a virus, I made it Open Source here on GitHub!

Also yes, this entire thing is a joke :)

## Building
Setup HaxeFlixel (I don't think this requires and external libraries.)

Guide for that is here: [HaxeFlixel Setup Documentation](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/setup/)

Then go to the location of the code with CMD or whatever terminal you use and type:

lime test -Build Target Goes Here (windows, html5, etc.)-
